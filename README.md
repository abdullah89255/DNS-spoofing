# DNS-spoofing
**DNS spoofing**, also known as **DNS cache poisoning**, is a type of cyber attack where an attacker alters the Domain Name System (DNS) records to redirect traffic intended for a legitimate website to a malicious one. This allows attackers to steal sensitive information, distribute malware, or carry out other malicious activities.

### How It Works:
1. **DNS Basics**: DNS translates human-readable domain names (e.g., `example.com`) into IP addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.1`) that computers use to locate websites.

2. **Spoofing the Cache**: In a DNS spoofing attack, the attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the DNS server or cache. They inject false DNS records into the server's cache, associating the target domain (e.g., `bank.com`) with an attacker-controlled IP address.

3. **Redirecting Users**: When users attempt to visit the targeted domain, the DNS server provides the forged IP address, redirecting them to a fake website that looks like the legitimate one.

4. **Harvesting Data or Malware Distribution**: Once users are on the fake site, attackers can:
   - Steal login credentials, credit card details, or other sensitive data.
   - Deliver malicious software to the userâ€™s device.

### Common Methods of DNS Spoofing:
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**: Intercepting communication between a user's device and the DNS server to inject malicious records.
- **Compromising DNS Servers**: Gaining unauthorized access to a DNS server to modify its records directly.
- **Exploiting Software Bugs**: Using vulnerabilities in DNS software to insert false entries.

### Prevention and Mitigation:
- **DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions)**: Adds cryptographic signatures to DNS records to ensure their authenticity.
- **Use Trusted DNS Servers**: Rely on DNS providers known for strong security practices.
- **Cache Flushing**: Regularly clear DNS cache to remove potentially poisoned entries.
- **Encryption**: Use secure protocols like HTTPS, DNS over HTTPS (DoH), or DNS over TLS (DoT).
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Watch for suspicious DNS activity or unexpected redirections.

Understanding DNS spoofing and implementing preventative measures are essential for maintaining secure online communication and protecting sensitive information.
### **DNS Cache Poisoning Attack: Details and Explanation**
---
---
**DNS cache poisoning** is a cyberattack where an attacker manipulates the cache of a DNS server or client to associate a legitimate domain name (e.g., `example.com`) with a malicious IP address. This redirects users to a malicious website without their knowledge.

### **How DNS Cache Poisoning Works**

1. **DNS Query Basics**:
   - When you visit a website, your browser queries a DNS server to resolve the domain name into an IP address.
   - DNS servers cache this response to speed up future queries.

2. **The Attack**:
   - Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in DNS systems to insert malicious DNS records into the cache.
   - When subsequent queries are made, the poisoned cache serves the forged response, redirecting users to attacker-controlled resources.

3. **Common Methods**:
   - **Forged Responses**:
     - The attacker sends fake DNS responses to the DNS server or client faster than the legitimate server.
   - **Exploiting Vulnerabilities**:
     - Older or misconfigured DNS servers with weak security practices are targeted.
   - **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**:
     - The attacker intercepts DNS requests and injects malicious records.

### **Step-by-Step Example of DNS Cache Poisoning**

#### **1. Normal DNS Resolution**:
- A user queries `bank.com`, and the DNS resolver contacts the authoritative DNS server for the IP address (e.g., `192.0.2.1`).
- The resolver caches this response to speed up future queries.

#### **2. Attacker Exploits the Cache**:
- The attacker sends a fake DNS response to the resolver, claiming that `bank.com` points to their malicious server (e.g., `203.0.113.10`).
- If the resolver accepts this forged response, it caches the malicious IP address.

#### **3. Redirecting the User**:
- When the user visits `bank.com` again, the resolver returns the poisoned IP address (`203.0.113.10`).
- The user is directed to the attacker's phishing site, which might look identical to the legitimate one.

#### **4. Exploitation**:
- The phishing site steals login credentials, credit card information, or distributes malware.

### **Real-Life Examples of DNS Cache Poisoning**

1. **Kaminsky Attack (2008)**:
   - Security researcher Dan Kaminsky demonstrated a severe vulnerability in DNS systems.
   - Attackers could poison DNS caches by exploiting the lack of randomness in DNS transaction IDs and source ports.
   - The vulnerability was widely patched, but it highlighted the fragility of DNS.

2. **Brazilian Banking Attacks (2016)**:
   - Attackers poisoned DNS caches of routers, redirecting users of legitimate banking sites to malicious servers.
   - These attacks exploited default or weak credentials on home routers.

---

### **Detection of DNS Cache Poisoning**
1. **Unexpected Website Behavior**:
   - Familiar websites behaving strangely or requesting sensitive information unusually.
2. **DNS Response Discrepancies**:
   - Use tools like `dig` or `nslookup` to manually query DNS servers and compare IP addresses.
3. **Untrusted SSL Certificates**:
   - Check for invalid or mismatched HTTPS certificates.

---

### **Defenses Against DNS Cache Poisoning**

1. **DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions)**:
   - Adds cryptographic signatures to DNS records, ensuring their authenticity and preventing tampering.

2. **Randomized Query Parameters**:
   - Modern DNS resolvers use random source ports and transaction IDs, making it harder for attackers to guess and spoof responses.

3. **Use Encrypted DNS Protocols**:
   - **DNS over HTTPS (DoH)** or **DNS over TLS (DoT)** encrypts DNS traffic, preventing interception and manipulation.

4. **Regularly Flush DNS Cache**:
   - Clear potentially poisoned cache entries on DNS servers and client devices.

5. **Harden DNS Servers**:
   - Apply patches and updates to DNS software regularly.
   - Restrict access to DNS servers and limit zones that accept external updates.

6. **Monitor and Audit DNS Logs**:
   - Regularly review DNS activity for signs of poisoning, such as unexpected IP addresses for known domains.

### **Conclusion**

DNS cache poisoning is a significant threat, as it exploits the trust users place in DNS systems. By implementing strong security measures, such as DNSSEC and encrypted DNS protocols, organizations and individuals can protect against such attacks.
