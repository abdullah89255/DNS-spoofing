# DNS-spoofing
**DNS spoofing**, also known as **DNS cache poisoning**, is a type of cyber attack where an attacker alters the Domain Name System (DNS) records to redirect traffic intended for a legitimate website to a malicious one. This allows attackers to steal sensitive information, distribute malware, or carry out other malicious activities.

### How It Works:
1. **DNS Basics**: DNS translates human-readable domain names (e.g., `example.com`) into IP addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.1`) that computers use to locate websites.

2. **Spoofing the Cache**: In a DNS spoofing attack, the attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the DNS server or cache. They inject false DNS records into the server's cache, associating the target domain (e.g., `bank.com`) with an attacker-controlled IP address.

3. **Redirecting Users**: When users attempt to visit the targeted domain, the DNS server provides the forged IP address, redirecting them to a fake website that looks like the legitimate one.

4. **Harvesting Data or Malware Distribution**: Once users are on the fake site, attackers can:
   - Steal login credentials, credit card details, or other sensitive data.
   - Deliver malicious software to the userâ€™s device.

### Common Methods of DNS Spoofing:
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**: Intercepting communication between a user's device and the DNS server to inject malicious records.
- **Compromising DNS Servers**: Gaining unauthorized access to a DNS server to modify its records directly.
- **Exploiting Software Bugs**: Using vulnerabilities in DNS software to insert false entries.

### Prevention and Mitigation:
- **DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions)**: Adds cryptographic signatures to DNS records to ensure their authenticity.
- **Use Trusted DNS Servers**: Rely on DNS providers known for strong security practices.
- **Cache Flushing**: Regularly clear DNS cache to remove potentially poisoned entries.
- **Encryption**: Use secure protocols like HTTPS, DNS over HTTPS (DoH), or DNS over TLS (DoT).
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Watch for suspicious DNS activity or unexpected redirections.

Understanding DNS spoofing and implementing preventative measures are essential for maintaining secure online communication and protecting sensitive information.
