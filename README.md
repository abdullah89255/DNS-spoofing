# DNS-spoofing
**DNS spoofing**, also known as **DNS cache poisoning**, is a type of cyber attack where an attacker alters the Domain Name System (DNS) records to redirect traffic intended for a legitimate website to a malicious one. This allows attackers to steal sensitive information, distribute malware, or carry out other malicious activities.

### How It Works:
1. **DNS Basics**: DNS translates human-readable domain names (e.g., `example.com`) into IP addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.1`) that computers use to locate websites.

2. **Spoofing the Cache**: In a DNS spoofing attack, the attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the DNS server or cache. They inject false DNS records into the server's cache, associating the target domain (e.g., `bank.com`) with an attacker-controlled IP address.

3. **Redirecting Users**: When users attempt to visit the targeted domain, the DNS server provides the forged IP address, redirecting them to a fake website that looks like the legitimate one.

4. **Harvesting Data or Malware Distribution**: Once users are on the fake site, attackers can:
   - Steal login credentials, credit card details, or other sensitive data.
   - Deliver malicious software to the user’s device.

### Common Methods of DNS Spoofing:
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**: Intercepting communication between a user's device and the DNS server to inject malicious records.
- **Compromising DNS Servers**: Gaining unauthorized access to a DNS server to modify its records directly.
- **Exploiting Software Bugs**: Using vulnerabilities in DNS software to insert false entries.

### Prevention and Mitigation:
- **DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions)**: Adds cryptographic signatures to DNS records to ensure their authenticity.
- **Use Trusted DNS Servers**: Rely on DNS providers known for strong security practices.
- **Cache Flushing**: Regularly clear DNS cache to remove potentially poisoned entries.
- **Encryption**: Use secure protocols like HTTPS, DNS over HTTPS (DoH), or DNS over TLS (DoT).
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Watch for suspicious DNS activity or unexpected redirections.

Understanding DNS spoofing and implementing preventative measures are essential for maintaining secure online communication and protecting sensitive information.
### **DNS Cache Poisoning Attack: Details and Explanation**
---
---
**DNS cache poisoning** is a cyberattack where an attacker manipulates the cache of a DNS server or client to associate a legitimate domain name (e.g., `example.com`) with a malicious IP address. This redirects users to a malicious website without their knowledge.

---

### **How DNS Cache Poisoning Works**

1. **DNS Query Basics**:
   - When you visit a website, your browser queries a DNS server to resolve the domain name into an IP address.
   - DNS servers cache this response to speed up future queries.

2. **The Attack**:
   - Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in DNS systems to insert malicious DNS records into the cache.
   - When subsequent queries are made, the poisoned cache serves the forged response, redirecting users to attacker-controlled resources.

3. **Common Methods**:
   - **Forged Responses**:
     - The attacker sends fake DNS responses to the DNS server or client faster than the legitimate server.
   - **Exploiting Vulnerabilities**:
     - Older or misconfigured DNS servers with weak security practices are targeted.
   - **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**:
     - The attacker intercepts DNS requests and injects malicious records.

### **Step-by-Step Example of DNS Cache Poisoning**

#### **1. Normal DNS Resolution**:
- A user queries `bank.com`, and the DNS resolver contacts the authoritative DNS server for the IP address (e.g., `192.0.2.1`).
- The resolver caches this response to speed up future queries.

#### **2. Attacker Exploits the Cache**:
- The attacker sends a fake DNS response to the resolver, claiming that `bank.com` points to their malicious server (e.g., `203.0.113.10`).
- If the resolver accepts this forged response, it caches the malicious IP address.

#### **3. Redirecting the User**:
- When the user visits `bank.com` again, the resolver returns the poisoned IP address (`203.0.113.10`).
- The user is directed to the attacker's phishing site, which might look identical to the legitimate one.

#### **4. Exploitation**:
- The phishing site steals login credentials, credit card information, or distributes malware.

### **Real-Life Examples of DNS Cache Poisoning**

1. **Kaminsky Attack (2008)**:
   - Security researcher Dan Kaminsky demonstrated a severe vulnerability in DNS systems.
   - Attackers could poison DNS caches by exploiting the lack of randomness in DNS transaction IDs and source ports.
   - The vulnerability was widely patched, but it highlighted the fragility of DNS.

2. **Brazilian Banking Attacks (2016)**:
   - Attackers poisoned DNS caches of routers, redirecting users of legitimate banking sites to malicious servers.
   - These attacks exploited default or weak credentials on home routers.

---

### **Detection of DNS Cache Poisoning**
1. **Unexpected Website Behavior**:
   - Familiar websites behaving strangely or requesting sensitive information unusually.
2. **DNS Response Discrepancies**:
   - Use tools like `dig` or `nslookup` to manually query DNS servers and compare IP addresses.
3. **Untrusted SSL Certificates**:
   - Check for invalid or mismatched HTTPS certificates.

---

### **Defenses Against DNS Cache Poisoning**

1. **DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions)**:
   - Adds cryptographic signatures to DNS records, ensuring their authenticity and preventing tampering.

2. **Randomized Query Parameters**:
   - Modern DNS resolvers use random source ports and transaction IDs, making it harder for attackers to guess and spoof responses.

3. **Use Encrypted DNS Protocols**:
   - **DNS over HTTPS (DoH)** or **DNS over TLS (DoT)** encrypts DNS traffic, preventing interception and manipulation.

4. **Regularly Flush DNS Cache**:
   - Clear potentially poisoned cache entries on DNS servers and client devices.

5. **Harden DNS Servers**:
   - Apply patches and updates to DNS software regularly.
   - Restrict access to DNS servers and limit zones that accept external updates.

6. **Monitor and Audit DNS Logs**:
   - Regularly review DNS activity for signs of poisoning, such as unexpected IP addresses for known domains.

### **1. Advanced DNS Cache Poisoning with MITM Attack**
#### **Scenario**:
An attacker performs a **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** attack on a corporate network, intercepting DNS queries between users and the DNS resolver.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Network Access**:
   - The attacker gains access to the victim’s network (e.g., via compromised Wi-Fi or internal network access).
   
2. **Interception**:
   - Using tools like Ettercap, the attacker intercepts DNS queries.
   
3. **Injection of Malicious DNS Records**:
   - The attacker responds to the DNS query with a malicious IP address before the legitimate DNS resolver can respond.
   
4. **Result**:
   - Users are redirected to phishing pages (e.g., fake corporate login portals).
   - Attackers harvest login credentials or distribute malware.

#### **Advanced Technique**:
- The attacker uses **DNS spoofing tools like DnsSpoof or Cain & Abel** to automate query interception and response injection.
- To avoid detection, the fake site uses a valid-looking SSL certificate obtained via techniques like free certificate services or hacking legitimate ones.

### **2. Kaminsky Vulnerability Exploitation (Modern Variant)**
#### **Background**:
Dan Kaminsky demonstrated a significant DNS cache poisoning flaw in 2008, which exploited predictable transaction IDs in DNS requests.

#### **Advanced Exploit**:
Even with modern randomization, attackers can exploit weak implementations or bypass mitigations:
1. **Flooding the Resolver**:
   - Attackers send thousands of forged responses with guessed transaction IDs and randomized ports.
   
2. **Racing Against Legitimate Responses**:
   - If the attacker's response reaches the resolver before the legitimate DNS server, it is cached.

3. **Targeting Shared Resolvers**:
   - Public DNS resolvers (e.g., ISPs or open DNS providers) are particularly vulnerable because poisoning their cache affects multiple users.

#### **Impact**:
Entire domains, like `google.com` or `paypal.com`, can be hijacked for all users relying on the compromised resolver.

---

### **3. IoT-Based DNS Cache Poisoning**
#### **Scenario**:
An attacker targets **smart home devices** (e.g., IoT cameras, routers, or smart speakers) with default or weak passwords.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Compromising IoT Devices**:
   - Using tools like Shodan, attackers locate vulnerable IoT devices exposed online.
   - Gain access using weak credentials or unpatched firmware.

2. **DNS Configuration Manipulation**:
   - Attackers modify the DNS settings on the device to use their malicious DNS server.

3. **Persistent Poisoning**:
   - Once modified, all devices on the local network querying the IoT device for DNS resolution are redirected to attacker-controlled servers.

#### **Impact**:
- Redirects users to phishing sites.
- Persistent because the poisoned cache remains active until the IoT device settings are reset.

---

### **4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and DNS Cache Poisoning**
#### **Scenario**:
An attacker combines a **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack** on a vulnerable website with DNS poisoning.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Inject Malicious Script**:
   - The attacker exploits an XSS vulnerability in a popular site to inject malicious JavaScript.
   
2. **Force User-Side DNS Queries**:
   - The script forces users' browsers to query specific subdomains controlled by the attacker (e.g., `attacker.subdomain.example.com`).

3. **DNS Cache Injection**:
   - The attacker’s rogue DNS server responds with fake IP addresses for legitimate subdomains.

4. **Impact**:
   - Subsequent visits to the parent domain (`example.com`) resolve to the attacker's server instead of the legitimate one.

---

### **5. Multi-Stage Supply Chain DNS Cache Poisoning**
#### **Scenario**:
An attacker targets a software vendor using DNS cache poisoning to compromise the update mechanism of their application.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Target the Vendor’s DNS Cache**:
   - The attacker poisons the DNS cache of the software vendor’s DNS server, redirecting requests for update files to a malicious server.

2. **Compromising the Update**:
   - When end users' software requests updates, it retrieves malware instead of legitimate updates.

3. **Payload Execution**:
   - Malware executes on users' devices, enabling remote access, data exfiltration, or further exploitation.

#### **Advanced Techniques**:
- Use of valid digital certificates to sign the malicious update, increasing trust.
- Employing fileless malware to evade detection.

---

### **6. Exploiting CDN Dependencies via Cache Poisoning**
#### **Scenario**:
An attacker targets Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) that cache DNS results for faster content delivery.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Poison CDN DNS Cache**:
   - The attacker sends forged DNS responses to the CDN’s resolver, redirecting requests for a popular domain (e.g., `cdn.example.com`) to a malicious server.

2. **Serve Malicious Content**:
   - Users accessing legitimate sites that rely on the poisoned CDN receive malicious content (e.g., scripts, images, or files).

3. **Broad Reach**:
   - The attack affects thousands or millions of users accessing sites dependent on the CDN.

---

### **7. DNS Rebinding with Cache Poisoning**
#### **Scenario**:
An attacker combines **DNS rebinding** with cache poisoning to compromise devices behind a firewall.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Setup Malicious Domain**:
   - The attacker registers a domain (e.g., `malicious.com`) and configures it to resolve to different IPs based on TTL.

2. **Poison the Resolver Cache**:
   - The DNS resolver caches the malicious domain’s IP, redirecting traffic to the attacker’s server.

3. **Rebind and Attack Local Network**:
   - The attacker forces the malicious domain to resolve to an internal IP address of the victim’s local network (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).

4. **Access Local Resources**:
   - The attacker can now interact with devices or servers within the victim's private network.

#### **Impact**:
- Unauthorized access to internal systems.
- Exfiltration of sensitive data.
